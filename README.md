Full analysis of *F. vesca* circadian clock gene expression in differential photoperiod treatments via RT-qPCR

# Overview
Quantitative real-time PCR is an important technique in analyzing real-time gene expression analysis. Gene expression analysis software is expensive, and calculation of relative expression of target gene using a reference gene is relatively straight-forward. This document includes the methods used in this master thesis to relatively quantify gene expression of qPCR.

# Content 
Each run is an individual CSV file (1-32) representing one gene tested per biological replicate. Runs were grouped together by biological replicate (BR). 

1. Each BR dataframe includes: 
    * clean up:
        * unneccessary columns dropped
        * NaN's renamed to NTC or IRC
        * Cq's of 0 dropped
        * High samples removed (Cq values (>30) for the majority of genes tested)
    * pivot table
        * comparative Cq method 

Omitted samples:
    * From cDNA synthesis: 
        * N2:  1A_2 , 4B_3, 11C_2 , 10A_3
        * I1:  2B_2 , 10B_2    
   *  From qPCR analysis due to high samples: 
        * N2: 5A_1
        * I1: 8A_1, 11B_1, 13C_1, 13D_1, 1A_2, 1B_2, 7B_2, 7B_3, 13B_3


Cq values represent the number of PCR cycles needed to observe a certain threshold of fluorescence for each sample. DNA sequences are doubled each cycle, so Cq values are on a log2 scale (1 cycle = 2x original sequence abundance, 2 cycles = 4x original sequence abundance), therefore higher Cq values corresponds to lower DNA expression levels. 

To normalize the Cq data, target gene Cq values can be compared to an internal control/reference gene Cq value in each sample. 
This gives a change in Cq value (ΔCq) for each gene, then to convert ΔCq values from a log2 to a linear scale, we take 2 to the power of -ΔCq.

the 2^-ΔCq method is appropriate where: 
    deltaCq =  (CQ gene of interest - CQ internal control).


2. Inter-Run-Calibrator (IRC) dataframe includes:
    * Grouped by plate
    * Fit Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model using an estimation method
        * estimate relationship between plate and Cq values  

4. Verify reference gene expression
    * Compare reference gene expression for each clone to identify if GAPDH or MSI1 change expression under treatment. 
    * One-Way ANOVA test
        1: Fit OLS model
            * estimate relationship between treatment and Cq values
        2: Pass fitted model into ANOVA method to produce ANOVA table
            * Check that data does not violate assumption of normally distributed residuals, or homogenity of variance.
            
5. Analyze Target Genes
