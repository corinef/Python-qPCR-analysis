Full analysis of *F. vesca* circadian clock gene expression in differential photoperiod treatments via RT-qPCR

# Overview
Quantitative real-time PCR is an important technique in analyzing real-time gene expression analysis. Gene expression analysis software is expensive, and calculation of relative expression of target gene using a reference gene is relatively straight-forward. This document includes the methods used in this master thesis to relatively quantify gene expression of qPCR.

# Content 
Each run is an individual [Plate file](../thesis-Python-qPCR/Plate files) (1-32) representing one gene tested per biological replicate that *need to be downloaded* for use of this script. 
Runs were grouped together by biological replicate (BR). 

1. Each BR dataframe includes: 
    * clean up:
        * unneccessary columns dropped
        * NaN's renamed to NTC or IRC
        * Cq's of 0 dropped
        * High samples identified and removed (Cq values (>30))
    * pivot table
        * comparative Cq method 
            * ΔCq (Target Gene - Reference Gene)
            * 2<sup>-ΔCq

2. Inter-Run-Calibrator (IRC) dataframe includes:
    * Merge of all IRC data
    * Grouped by plate
    * Fit Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model using an estimation method
        * estimate relationship between plate and Cq values  

3. Merge of all data

4. Verify reference gene expression
    * Calculate average & st. dev. Cq values across replicates
    * Visualize data
      * Plot Cq values across samples
      * Plot average Cq values by treatment
    * Statistical analysis
      * Compare reference gene expression for each clone to identify if GAPDH or MSI1 change expression under treatment. 
      * One-Way ANOVA test
         1: Fit OLS model
            * estimate relationship between treatment and Cq values
         2: Pass fitted model into ANOVA method to produce ANOVA table
            * Check that data does not violate assumption of normally distributed residuals, or homogenity of variance.

5. Target Gene Figures
    * Calculate average & st. dev. 2<sup>-ΔCq values across replicates
    * Group by clone and treatment group
    * Visualize data
       * Plot each gene individually by treatment group
      
6. Target Gene Statistical Analysis
    * Independent Students T-tests for hypotheses
        * Independent variable: Treatment (4 levels) Zeitgeber (13 levels)
        * Dependent variable: 2<sup>-ΔCq
    * Pull statistically significant data (p<0.05) into individual dataframes


## Background information on qPCR data
Cq values represent the number of PCR cycles needed to observe a certain threshold of fluorescence for each sample. DNA sequences are doubled each cycle, so Cq values are on a log2 scale (1 cycle = 2x original sequence abundance, 2 cycles = 4x original sequence abundance), therefore higher Cq values corresponds to lower DNA expression levels. 

To normalize the Cq data, target gene Cq values can be compared to an internal control/reference gene Cq value in each sample. 
This gives a change in Cq value (ΔCq) for each gene, then to convert ΔCq values from a log2 to a linear scale, we take 2 to the power of -ΔCq.

the 2<sup>-ΔCq method is appropriate where: 
    deltaCq =  (CQ gene of interest - CQ internal control).
